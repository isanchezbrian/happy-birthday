                        <p>Happy Birthday beautiful! ❤️ Wow I don't even know where to start, I guess I'll start off by saying it’s your special day today. I want you to know I’m so grateful for having you in my life, for being my daily motivation! You just don’t know how much you mean to me and how thankful and appreciative I am for the little things you do for me. That spooky basket really solidified my love for you because I haven’t even told you why I was so stressed at the time, yet you still went out of your way to do that for me without knowing why. That was already gonna bring tears to me eyes when I had read the letter. It really meant a lot to me. I know I mentioned how you motivate me to be successful, but there’s so much more to that. Before you, I’ve mentioned how much of a reckless driver I was, that was because I accepted my fate. I didn’t have emotions anymore and I was tired of not being able to feel anything , that’s why I’m not scared of anything. Like I’m not scared to die and I felt like I was kinda looking for trouble in a way. I wasn’t scared when I’ve gotten a gun pulled on me, if anything I kinda asked for it by continuing the argument. But now I not only have a reason, but I to be careful and stay safe for you. I care about you so much and I love you so much. In regards to you going to the gym, I’m not upset baby I promise. I did feel some type of way at first yes, I guess maybe not only because I kept asking you to come with me, but because the gym has been kinda my hobby on and off for years and asking you to come with me felt like a step forward for us. I wouldn’t ask just any girl to go with me to the gym, like you legit have to mean something to me for me to even ask. But I promise it’s okay baby, I don’t mind if you go with your friends or coworkers, I still want you to get your gains and go at your own pace and not feel pressured. I love you too so much for me to feel any type of way for you even trying or even going to the gym. I really look forward to the future and having you be a part of that. When I first laid eyes on you, you intrigued me by how shy you seemed. You looked reserved and I was able to tell you were holding something back. It wasn't until we had went to Denny's that you kinda gave me a hint accidentally about your mom. You sharing your whole story with me must've taken a lot of strength and courage. Thank you for sharing that with me. Although, yes it's still soon to say. You're the person I see myself in the future with. The person I WANT to marry someday. I know everything is kinda all over the place, but I was just speaking my heart out in the moment. There's still a lot more I can say, but just know I really really really do love everything about you. Enjoy your birthday beautiful. ❤️ - Love Brian </p>
